difference between computer engineering and computer science.
computer engineering focus on both hardware and software, while computer science generally deals with software. However both are same. 
i want to know about computer engineering. 
Computer Science Engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with the design, implementation, management of information systems of both software and hardware processes. A computer Science Engineering student specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. The engineers are mainly involved in the development of the software and hardware systems of the various aspects of computing.

is going abroad now a trend for computer engineers.
In India we require so much skills to get a good job. Truely saying that jobs are absent for engineers in india. So students tend to migrate to other coutries like canada,America,Australia.Mostly ME/MTech courses are preferred.These countries have good economy and freshers are more suitable to get settled there.
